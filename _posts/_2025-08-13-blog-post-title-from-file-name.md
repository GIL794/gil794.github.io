# From Invisible to Discoverable: How to Make Your GitHub Blog Rank on Google with SEO

Hey there, Gabriele here!

When I first launched my blog on GitHub Pages, I assumed publishing great content was all it took for Google and other search engines to find me. Instead, my posts were like whispers in a stadium—technically online, but practically invisible to anyone searching for advice or inspiration.

Fast-forward to today, and my blog now appears for relevant searches: everything from "free gitHub blog portfolio" to "how to organize posts with Jekyll". What changed? **SEO**—search engine optimization. And while SEO can feel mysterious (or intimidating), I promise: anyone can make their blog discoverable with a few simple steps, no coding degree required.

Ready to go from invisible to discoverable? Let’s dive in!

## **Why SEO Matters for Your GitHub Blog**

GitHub Pages make it easy and free to publish a blog, but by default, **search engines don't know your content exists**. Without SEO, all your insights, portfolio pieces, and helpful posts stay hidden.

If you want your blog to rank—and draw real visitors—**basic SEO is essential**. It’s how Google figures out what your site is about, who it's for, and when to show it in search results.

---

## **Step 1: Use Keyword-Rich Titles & Headings**

Keywords are simply the words and phrases people use when searching on Google ("free productivity tools", "github blog tutorial"). Including these naturally in your blog titles, post headings (`#`, `##`), and first paragraphs makes it clear to search engines what your content covers.

**How to do it:**
- Use your main keyword in the blog post’s title (e.g., "How to Start a Free Blog Portfolio on GitHub" instead of "My Journey Online").
- Sprinkle related keywords in section headers and throughout the post.

**Example keywords for your blog:**  
`free portfolio`, `github blog tips`, `seo on github pages`, `online presence`, `tech productivity`, `how to rank on google`

---

## **Step 2: Write Descriptive File Names (and Front Matter)**

Search engines love clarity. Instead of `post1.md`, name your file `2025-08-09-seo-tips-for-github-blog.md`. Include your main keyword in the filename and in your post’s front matter, like this:

```
***
layout: default
title: "From Invisible to Discoverable: How to Make Your GitHub Blog Rank on Google with SEO"
categories: [SEO, Blogging]
tags: [github blog, seo, google ranking]
***
```

**Why it matters:**  
Google and other engines scan file names and metadata to understand your pages.

---

## **Step 3: Optimize Your README.md and Index.md**

Both your `README.md` and `index.md` files are often indexed by Google. Make sure these feature:
- A clear, keyword-rich intro (who you are, what your blog is about)
- Links to your most valuable or popular posts
- Your top categories

**Example:**

```

```

---

## **Step 4: Create and Link Category & Archive Pages**

Google loves websites with clear navigation and internal linking. Having a `categories.md` page (listing every topic) and a `blog.md` page (an archive of all posts) helps both visitors and search engines explore your site.

**Keep navigation easy to crawl:**
- Link to category/archive pages in your top menu (`_layouts/default.html`)
- Use keyword-based naming (e.g., `/categories.html`, `/blog.html`)

---

## **Step 5: Interlink Your Posts (Internal Linking)**

Whenever you publish a new post, link to related articles and category pages within your text. For instance:

> "For more productivity hacks, check out my [Inbox Zero Email Guide](2025-08-08-email-chaos-inbox-zero.md)."

**Why?**  
Internal linking guides visitors deeper into your content and signals relevance to Google.

---

## **Step 6: Add Metadata for Social Sharing (Open Graph/Twitter Cards)**

While not strictly necessary for Google, adding descriptive metadata helps your posts look sharp when shared on social media—driving more traffic and signals to search engines.

Add this to your post’s front matter:

```
***

description: "A practical guide by Gabriele Langellotto. Learn how to set up SEO for your GitHub blog and make it rank on Google."
image: /assets/images/seo-github-preview.png
categories: [SEO, Blogging]
tags: [github blog, seo, google ranking]
***
```

---

## **Step 7: Share and Build Links (Off-Site SEO)**

Once your blog post is live, share it with your network on LinkedIn, X (Twitter), forums, and relevant online communities. If others link to your blog, Google notices—and your rankings jump.

**Practical sharing tips:**
- Announce new posts on LinkedIn and mention relevant keywords in your description.
- Join communities like dev.to or Hashnode and cross-post snippets with a link back.

---

## **Step 8: Keep Content Fresh and Update Old Posts**

Search engines reward fresh, regularly updated sites. Every so often, update your existing posts with new insights, resources, or links.

**Simple routine:**
- Once a month, review older posts and add a new tip, link, or paragraph.

---

## **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

- **Too many keywords:** Keyword stuffing hurts your ranking and makes posts hard to read.
- **Broken links/navigation:** Regularly test your menu and internal links. Fix or remove any dead pages.
- **Neglecting mobile:** GitHub Pages are responsive, but keep layouts simple for best results.

## **My Journey: From Invisible to Discoverable**

Before applying these SEO steps, my posts were buried on result page 10 (if they appeared at all). After just a few weeks of consistent keyword use, internal linking, and sharing with fellow creators, my blog began ranking for topics like "free blog github" and "productivity hacks for professionals."

It's not magic or luck—just a series of small, deliberate steps that make your blog visible to the world.
