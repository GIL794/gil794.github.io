## Blog Post Title From First Header
### so you name it: "2025-08-08-blog-post-title-from-file-name.md" but the title it will get it above
Due to a plugin called `jekyll-titles-from-headings` which is supported by GitHub Pages by default. The above header (in the markdown file) will be automatically used as the pages title.

If the file does not start with a header, then the post title will be derived from the filename.

This is a sample blog post. You can talk about all sorts of fun things here.
