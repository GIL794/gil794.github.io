## Do not change the name of this Readme, is spelled wrong so your blog always pull your index


Once you fork this repo, rename it with your username.github.io and save. Wait for a couple of minutes and your blog is ready to go, with my content, so make sure to modify the following pages:
- Index
- Zabout 
- Zacontact
- _config

These pages contain most of the basic information about you, make sure to modify according to your need and preferences.

The name of the pages are on purpose to have the order as you see on your 'top menu'

_posts folder has already a old post you can use as template for your future blog contents. 

Layouts/categories has already 3 categories that, if you want to create more, you just need to copy the code, paste it in the new category and change the name accordingly.



Created thanks the awesome easy guide at: https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html CHECK IT OUT!!

After forking the above repo I added some key features and pages to the template. Enjoy that version and, don't worry, zabout and zacontact are on purpose to appear at the end, change the name if you want to change the order.
